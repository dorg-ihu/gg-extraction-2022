## üßê Problem Definition <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
The administration of countries as well as the structure of the respective ministries are constantly changing. This fact, leads to redefinition of internal structure between Governmental Units and their responsibilities quite often. To manually extract the information and construct organization charts in parallel with responsibility assignments between ORgs is a time-consuming process. Based on that, this tool aims to automatically extract the RELATIONS and the RESPONSIBILITIES that a Public Administration Organization Presidential Decree may contain.
